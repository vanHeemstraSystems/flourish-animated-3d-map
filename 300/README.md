## 100 - 3D Map with Custom Tiles using JSON

With the JSON option, you can fully customize the styles of your map or import vector styles you created on another platform.

As we use tiles that match the OpenMapTiles schema, it's recommended to use [Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/) or MapTiler to create styles. 

Simply use the editor to create a style of your liking and export the JSON file. Then copy the contents of the JSON file into the text box. Keep in mind you will need a [Maptiler](https://www.maptiler.com/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) or Thunderforest Access Token to export the JSON file.
